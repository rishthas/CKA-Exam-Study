# Cluster Architecture:

## Kubernetes Master Componenets:

Master node has  the below list of components. 
- ### ETCD : 
  - Stores cluster information and state of the Cluster.
  - ETCD stores in key and value pair. 

- ### API Server: 
  - Responsible for all orchastration operations with the cluster. 
  - Exposing Kube-API/Mgmt
  - Monitors state of Cluster
  - Gives work to worker nodes

- ### Controller Manager:
  - #### Node-controller
    - Takes care of nodes, onboarding new nodes to cluster and handling situation where nodes become unavailable and gets destroyed. 

  - #### Replication-Controller
    - Ensures rights amounts of containers are running at all times in replication group according to the replication configurations. 

- ### Kube Scheduler: 
  - Identfies the right node to place the container based on container resource requirements, taints and tolerations ,capacity etc. 


## Worker nodes:

- ### Kubelet: 
  - Agents running on each node of the cluser
  - Responsible for liasing with the master node (api-server), sending reports back to master on status of cluster etc. 
  - The API -Server Periodically fetches status reports from the kubelet.

- ### Kube-Proxy: 
  - Ensures network rules are in place, rules are in place to reach services within the cluster.

- ### Container Runtime: 
  - Software which runs the containerised application. 

# POD
- Container/s are encapsulate to POD in K8s
- Containers in POD can communicate as localhost.
  
  - `kubectl run nginx --image=nginx`
  - `kubectls get pods`
  - `kubectl describe pod nginx`
  - `kubectl get pods -o wide`


# YAML
- Represents configuration data 
- Key value pair

- Array List  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64813710/226235623-a99438fc-cc6e-4108-9466-878b16ec86ed.png)

- Dictionary/Map

# PODS in YAML

- pod-defination.yaml
  - apiVersion 
  - kind
  - metadata
  - spec  
  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64813710/226236832-601c327f-80bd-492a-9980-c774b34fe03e.png)

## Replication Controller and ReplicaSet
- **Controllers** are brain for K8s
### Replication Controller
  - helps run multiple instance of a POD
  - also automatically bring up the  POD if the POD fails.
  - load balancing and scaling
  - can span multiple nodes.
### ReplicaSet 
- is the new one and recomentent.
  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64813710/226240021-5ba04e45-05a3-4050-99ba-60472fb73cef.png)
  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64813710/226240625-f57db92d-09fc-4622-a640-e0a7af30fba3.png)
- **Scale Replica**
- Change replica in yaml and run 
  - `kubectl replace -f replicset-definition.yaml`
- `kubectl scale --replicas=6 -f eplicset-definition.yaml`

### Deployments
- Upgrade policy.
- over replica set.
- yml same as Replica set, but different 
  - `kind: Deployment`
    > kubectl get all
    > To get all the objects
  #### Update and Rollback
  - First deployment will trigger furst rollout
  - K8s tracks each updates as a rollout.
  - Command to find the status of the rollout
    - ` kubectl rollout status  <deployement tag>`
  - For history
    - ` kubectl rollout history <deployment tag>`
  #### Deployment Strategy
  - ##### Recreate
    - Destroy the current deployement and deploy the new version.
      - The application will be down for this window.
  - ##### Rolling
    - Default.
    - One by One each pod will be brought up and deleted.
  - ` kubectl apply -f <deployemnt file> `
  - ` kubetcl set image <new image> `
    ` kubectl describe <deployemnt> `
  
  #### Rollback
  - ` kubectl rollout undo <deployment tag>`

# Networking in K8s
- node has an IP 
- POD is has its own internal IP

# Services
  - Enable communicatation within k8s cluster.
  - Enable loose coupling.
  


# Setups
  ## Minikube
  - All the components into a single image ISO online.
  - Must have Hypervisor like Virtualbox.
  ## Kubeadmin
  - kubeadmin takes care all step.
  - Must have
    1. Multiple system or virtual machine
    2. docker installed in all nodes.
    3. kubeadmin installed in all the node.
    4. initialize master node.
    5. POD network.
    6. Join worker node to master

# ETCD
## ETCD For Beginners:

- ETCD is a Key Value store
- Used to store and restore 
### Install ETCD
1. Download Binaries
2. Extract
3. Run ETCD Services

- Default port `2379`
- Default client is
  - `etcdctl`
  - `etcdctl set key1 value1`
  - `etcdctl get key1`
  - `etcdctl --version`

## ETCD In Kubernetes:

List the following componenets
- Nodes
- Pods
- Configs
- Secrets
- Accounts
- Roles
- Bindings
- Others
- All information is updated on the ETCD Cluster
- Uses port 2379 `--adevertise-client-urls https://${INTERNAL_IP}:2379`
- ETCD in HA Enviroment, can have multiple ETCD in a Cluster. 
  - `--initial-cluster controller-0=https://${IP}:2379,controller-2=https://${IP}:2379`  in HA
- **kubeadm**
 - `kubectl get pods -n kube-system`




# Kube-API Server:

- Primary mgmt component in Kubernetes

1. When you run a Kubectl command it reaches the Kube-API Server. The Kube-API Server first validates the request.
2. The Kube-API retrieves the data from the ETCD Cluster and responds back. Or you can simply run a post request. 
3. The Kube-Scheduler continously monitors the API Server and if a new pod with no node assigned to it, 
4. the scheduler identifies a node to put the pod on it and communicats that back to the API Server. 
5. the API Server updates the information in the ETCD Cluster. 
6. The API Server then passes information to the Kubelet to create the pod on the new node, 
7. the kublet instructs the container runtime to deploy the image, 
8. The Kubelet then updates the API-Server 
9. then the ETCD Is updated by the API-Server. 

Kube-Api Server: Does the following,

- Authenticates users
- Validates request
- Retrieves data
- Updates ETCD
- Scheduler
- Kubelet

Kube-Controller Manager:

Node-Controller:

- Checks status on nodes every 5 sec
- waits 40 sec before marking down as unreachable
- POD Eviction 5 min


Kube-Scheduler:

- Right containers ends in right node
- Kube-Scheduler looks at resource contraints etc to determine which node the pod goes to.
- It will filter out the nodes which are not relevent to the specific node
- It then calculates if the nodes left are tie, it will rank them based on up-to 10, it will look how resources will be free after pod is placed on it. 


Kubelet:

- Load / Unload containers 
- Captain of the ship (Worker nodes)
- Send back report to API-Server 
- Tells Container run-time engine to docker to pull the required image


Kube-Proxy:

- By default every pod in a cluster can reach another pod 
- Pod can reach another pod based on its IP by networking
- creating a service to expose the service 
- Service has an ip assigned 
- when a pod tries to reach the service it forward traffic to backend pod through the pod
- Kube-Proxy is a process that runs on each node, looks for new services 
- creates appropiate rules when new services come in 
- creates ip tables rules on each node to forward traffic to the new service


POD Recap:

- Pods are the smallest objects which run on nodes, single instance of an application
- Can have multiple containers in a pod however not really good practice
- can have helped containers in the same pod or part of it. 
- If destroying container will also destroy same helper container


Pods with YAML:

Pod yml files always contain the following field, this is mandatory:

- apiVersion: version of k8s api used to create the object, must use the correct version for now using v1
- Kind: type of object for example pod, replica set, service etc
- Metadata: data about the object, names, labels etc.
- Spec: depending on the object additional information about the object, spec is a dictionary 

Practice test:

How to check default pods:
kubectl get pods -n default

how to create new nginx pod:
kubectl run nginx --image=nginx

How to check which image is running on pod?
kubectl desribe pods -n default xxxx 

which node is the pods placed on?
this will tell you via the describe pods commands, you then type in kubectl get nodes 

how many containers are running inside that pod?
describe command again however there maybe an easier command?

What images are used in the new webapp pod?
again describe command

What is the state of the container agentx in the pod webapp?
again describe command

Why do you think the container agentx in pod webapp is in error?
in describe by checking events 

What does the READY column in the output of the kubectl get pods command indicate?
Answer: Running Containers in POD/Total Containers in POD
  
Delete the webapp Pod.
kubectl delete pods -n default webapp

Create a new pod with the name redis and with the image redis123
1.  kubectl run redis --image=redis123 --dry-run=client -o yaml > redis-definition.yaml
2.  kubectl create -f redis-definition.yaml
3.  kubectl get pods

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    run: redis
  name: redis
spec:
  containers:
  - image: redis
    name: redis
    resources: {}
  dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
  restartPolicy: Always
status: {}
  
Replicasets:
  
Replication controller:
  
- If you have a single pod which crashed, to prevent users from loosing access their application we can create a replica set of the pod.
- Runs multiple instances of the pod
- ensures specifies ammount of pods are running at time
- to create multiple pods to share load it allows this. 
- if numbers of users increase you can increase pods, deploy additional pods on other nodes. 
- replications controller can span on different nodes 
- replication controller vs replica set, replication controller is the old technology and it is being replaced by replicaset. 
- When creating a replicaset.yml, this is the layout:
- Under the spec field, all the pods yml config in which you are tring to replicacate goes in there. 
 
  apiVersion: v1 
  kind: ReplicationController
  metadata: 
    name: myapp-rc
    labels:
        app: myapp
        type: front-end
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      name: myapp-pod
      labels:
          app: myapp
          type: front-end
  spec:
    containers:
    - name: nginx-containers
      image: nginx

replcas: 3
  
- kubectl create -f rc-definition.yml 
- kubectl get replicationcontroller
- kubectl get pods 

Replica-sets:
  
  apiVersion: apps/v1 
  kind: ReplicationController
  metadata: 
    name: myapp-rc
    labels:
        app: myapp
        type: front-end
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      name: myapp-pod
      labels:
          app: myapp
          type: front-end
  spec:
    containers:
    - name: nginx-containers
      image: nginx

replcas: 3
selector: 
   matchLabels:
      type: front-end
 #specifies what pods come under it, can also manage pods which were not created part of the replication configuraiton for example, pods created before -
 # the creation of replica set matched label for selector, main differences between replication controller. 
   
Labels and Selectors:
  
- for example If we deploy 3 instances of our front end app as 3 pods, we like to create replication-controllers/replicasets
- replicaset monitor pods and if they fail, it will deploy new ones
- it knows how to monitor pods via labelling as labels are referenced for the pods. 
- can use the kubectl replace -f replicaset-definition.yml command to update what was done. 
- or can also run this commanmd as imperitive
           - kubectl scale --replica=6 -f replicaset-definition.yml

  Replica-set practice test:
    
 -How many PODs exist on the system? 0
- How many ReplicaSets exist on the system? kubectl get replicasets -n default 0
- How about now? How many ReplicaSets do you see? kubectl get replicasets -n default 1
- How many PODs are DESIRED in the new-replica-set? kubectl get replicasets -n default 4
- What is the image used to create the pods in the new-replica-set? kubectl describe  replicasets -n default new-replica-set Image: busybox777
- How many PODs are READY in the new-replica-set? 0
- Why do you think the PODs are not ready? kubectl describe  pods -n default  new-replica-set-jf7jv = kubectl describe  pods -n default  new-replica-set-jf7jv Image does not exist
- Delete any one of the 4 PODs. = kubectl delete  pods -n default  new-replica-set-jf7jv
- How many PODs exist now? = kubectl get pods -n default still 4 as replicaset
- Why are there still 4 PODs, even after you deleted one? = ReplicaSet ensures that desired number of PODs always run
- Create a ReplicaSet using the replicaset-definition-1.yaml file located at /root/. There is an issue with the file, so try to fix it. Missing apps/v1, need to do this also kubectl create -f replicaset-definition-1.yaml
- Fix the issue in the replicaset-definition-2.yaml file and create a ReplicaSet using it. the matchlabel should match with labels under spec
- Delete the two newly created ReplicaSets - replicaset-1 and replicaset-2 = kubectl delete replicasets -n default replicaset-1
- Fix the original replica set new-replica-set to use the correct busybox image = kubectl edit replicaset -n default new-replica-set followed by deleting the pods and allowing it to recreate.
- Scale the ReplicaSet to 5 PODs. Use kubectl scale command or edit the replicaset using kubectl edit replicaset. kubectl edit replicaset -n default new-replica-set, delete pods and let it start recreate again
  kubectl scale rs new-replica-set --replicas=5
  
Kubernetes deployments:
  
- When upgrading kubernetes cluster, you dont do it all in one go however you do it one by one. 
- known as rolling updates
- should be able to roll back changes also
- deployments work higher, provides upgrading underlying instances seamlessly 
- the kubectl deployment automatically creates a replica set
- kubectl get all 

Create an NGINX Pod

kubectl run nginx --image=nginx

Generate POD Manifest YAML file (-o yaml). Don't create it(--dry-run)

kubectl run nginx --image=nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml

Create a deployment

kubectl create deployment --image=nginx nginx

Generate Deployment YAML file (-o yaml). Don't create it(--dry-run)

kubectl create deployment --image=nginx nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml

Generate Deployment YAML file (-o yaml). Don't create it(--dry-run) with 4 Replicas (--replicas=4)

kubectl create deployment --image=nginx nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml > nginx-deployment.yaml

Save it to a file, make necessary changes to the file (for example, adding more replicas) and then create the deployment.

kubectl create -f nginx-deployment.yaml

OR

In k8s version 1.19+, we can specify the --replicas option to create a deployment with 4 replicas.

kubectl create deployment --image=nginx nginx --replicas=4 --dry-run=client -o yaml > nginx-deployment.yaml
 
Creating a deployment yml

- How many ReplicaSets exist on the system now? 1
- How many PODs exist on the system now? 4
- Out of all the existing PODs, how many are ready? 0
- What is the image used to create the pods in the new deployment? busybox888
- Why do you think the deployment is not ready? image doesnt exist
- Create a new Deployment using the deployment-definition-1.yaml file located at /root/ kubectl create -f deployment-definition-1.yaml, need to edit kind field: should mention capital D in Deployment.
- Create a new Deployment with the below attributes using your own deployment definition file: kubectl create deployment httpd-frontend --image=httpd:2.4-alpine --replicas=3 --dry-run=client -o yaml > image-deployment.yml
  kubectl create -f image-deployment.yml

Namespaces:
  
- By default namespaces are isoloated location for enviroments, 
- services can reach other services in their own namespace
- services can reach other services in other namespaces however need to use the append the name of the namespace with service.
- kubectl create -f abc.yml -n xxxx
- can also specify a namespace in the yml file
- kubectl create namesapce xxxx
- by default you are placed in the default namesapce, to change this namespace from default, simply do this. 
  Kubectl config set-context current-context --namespace 
- you can limit resource quota in a namespace, create a resource quota simple. 
  
  Namespace test:
  
 - How many Namespaces exist on the system? 10 kubectl get namespace
 - How many pods exist in the research namespace? 2 kubectl get pods -n research
 - Create a POD in the finance namespace. kubectl run redis --image=redis -n finance or ...
   
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    run: redis
  name: redis
  namespace: finance <<<<-----------------------Added this namespace. 
spec:
  containers:
  - image: redis
    name: redis
    resources: {}
  dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
  restartPolicy: Always
status: {}
   
 - Which namespace has the blue pod in it? kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o wide = marketing namespace 
 - What DNS name should the Blue application use to access the database db-service in its own namespace - marketing.
   You can try it in the web application UI. Use port 6379. = 
 - What DNS name should the Blue application use to access the database 'db-service' in the 'dev' namespace = db-service as its in the same namespace.
   You can try it in the web application UI. Use port 6379. = db-service = db-service.dev.svc.cluster.local
   Since the blue application and the db-service are in different namespaces in this case, we need to use the service name along with the namespace to access the database. The FQDN (fully Qualified Domain Name) for the db-service in this example would be db-service.dev.svc.cluster.local.

 Kuberetes Services:
     
 - Enable communication from outside
 - provide customers with connectivity 
 - different types of services:
      - Node-Port: Listens to services on the node and forward requests to the pods: it checks this by looking at the labels of the pod to forward to. Uses a random algorism 
      - Cluster-ip: services creates virtual ip to create communication between different services. 
      - Load balancer: distribute load

- What is the type of the default kubernetes service? ClusterIp
- What is the targetPort configured on the kubernetes service? 6443
- How many labels are configured on the kubernetes service? 2 = component=apiserver / provider=kubernetes
- How many Endpoints are attached on the kubernetes service? 1 10.36.130.9:6443
- How many Deployments exist on the system now? 1 
- What is the image used to create the pods in the deployment? kodekloud/simple-webapp:red
- Are you able to accesss the Web App UI? No
- Create a new service to access the web application using the service-definition-1.yaml file 

While you would be working mostly the declarative way - using definition files, imperative commands can help in getting one time tasks done quickly, as well as generate a definition template easily. This would help save considerable amount of time during your exams.

Before we begin, familiarize with the two options that can come in handy while working with the below commands:

--dry-run: By default as soon as the command is run, the resource will be created. If you simply want to test your command , use the --dry-run=client option. This will not create the resource, instead, tell you whether the resource can be created and if your command is right.

-o yaml: This will output the resource definition in YAML format on screen.

Use the above two in combination to generate a resource definition file quickly, that you can then modify and create resources as required, instead of creating the files from scratch.


POD
Create an NGINX Pod

kubectl run nginx --image=nginx


Generate POD Manifest YAML file (-o yaml). Don't create it(--dry-run)

kubectl run nginx --image=nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml

Deployment
Create a deployment

kubectl create deployment --image=nginx nginx

Generate Deployment YAML file (-o yaml). Don't create it(--dry-run)

kubectl create deployment --image=nginx nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml

Generate Deployment with 4 Replicas

kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx --replicas=4

You can also scale a deployment using the kubectl scale command.

kubectl scale deployment nginx --replicas=4

Another way to do this is to save the YAML definition to a file and modify

kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml > nginx-deployment.yaml

You can then update the YAML file with the replicas or any other field before creating the deployment.

Service
Create a Service named redis-service of type ClusterIP to expose pod redis on port 6379

kubectl expose pod redis --port=6379 --name redis-service --dry-run=client -o yaml

(This will automatically use the pod's labels as selectors)

Or

kubectl create service clusterip redis --tcp=6379:6379 --dry-run=client -o yaml (This will not use the pods labels as selectors, instead it will assume selectors as app=redis. You cannot pass in selectors as an option. So it does not work very well if your pod has a different label set. So generate the file and modify the selectors before creating the service)

Create a Service named nginx of type NodePort to expose pod nginx's port 80 on port 30080 on the nodes:

kubectl expose pod nginx --type=NodePort --port=80 --name=nginx-service --dry-run=client -o yaml

(This will automatically use the pod's labels as selectors, but you cannot specify the node port. You have to generate a definition file and then add the node port in manually before creating the service with the pod.)

Or

kubectl create service nodeport nginx --tcp=80:80 --node-port=30080 --dry-run=client -o yaml

(This will not use the pods labels as selectors)

Both the above commands have their own challenges. While one of it cannot accept a selector the other cannot accept a node port. I would recommend going with the kubectl expose command. If you need to specify a node port, generate a definition file using the same command and manually input the nodeport before creating the 
 .

 
Imperative challenge:
 
- Deploy a pod named nginx-pod using the nginx:alpine image. kubectl run nginx-pod --image=nginx:alpine
- Deploy a redis pod using the redis:alpine image with the labels set to tier=db. kubectl run redis --image=redis:alpine --labels=tier=db
- Create a service redis-service to expose the redis application within the cluster on port 6379, kubectl expose pods redis --port=6379 --name=redis-service
- Create a deployment named webapp using the image kodekloud/webapp-color with 3 replicas. kubectl create  deployment webapp --image=kodekloud/webapp-color --replicas=3
- Create a new pod called custom-nginx using the nginx image and expose it on container port 8080.  kubectl run custom-nginx --image=nginx --port=8080
- Create a new namespace called dev-ns: kubectl create namespace dev-ns
- Create a new deployment called redis-deploy in the dev-ns namespace with the redis image. It should have 2 replicas = kubectl create deployment redis-deploy -n dev-ns --image=redis --replicas=2
- Create a pod called httpd using the image httpd:alpine in the default namespace. Next, create a service of type ClusterIP by the same name (httpd). The target port for the service should be 80.
     - kubectl run httpd --image=httpd:alpine --port=80 --expose

 Deployment:

- Each container is encapsulated in pods 
- multipled pods are deployed using replicasets 
- Deployments works higher in the k8s heighharphy 
- Deployments allow you to upgrade the underlying instances seemlessly using rolling updates 
- When running deployment it automatically create replicaset to use rolling updates 

Services:

- Allow you to connect to Pods using service load balancer
- Service types:
    - NodePort - Services makes internal pod accessible via a node, the external port has to be in a range of 3000 etc
          - Use labels under selector tab under matching pod, the service automatically select these pods to forwards request to
          - Uses random algorism to load balance to pods
    - ClusterIP - Services create virtual IP inside the cluster 
    - Loadbalancer - provision load balancer for application, distribute load to different web services.
